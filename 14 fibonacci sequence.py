Description:
You are responsible for writing a program that will compute the first n terms of the Fibonacci
Sequence. Your program will then display these terms. Next, your program will calculate the
ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers to prove that these ratios approach the irrational
mathematical constant of Phi; 1.618â€¦.
